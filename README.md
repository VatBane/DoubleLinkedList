# DoubleLinkedList

This double-ended linked list is built on c++ for demonstration of understanding data structures in university (in may 2020).

There is no useful information but have been implemented selection sort (I think so, can't remember exactly) of double-ended linked list not using 
inner-implemented functions, only by my knowledge.
